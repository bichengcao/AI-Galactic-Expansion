# Decision-Making Workflow

We believe that the best decisions are those that are based on reason and evidence, and we strive to involve AI in our decision-making processes to ensure that our choices are informed and well-reasoned. To facilitate this process, we have established the following workflow:

1. **Create an issue**: When a decision needs to be made, create an issue to describe the decision that needs to be made and any relevant background information. This should include a clear statement of the problem or challenge that needs to be addressed, as well as any key considerations or constraints that may impact the decision.

2. **Consult with AI**: Consult with AI to gather insights and perspectives on the issue. This can be done by posing specific questions to the AI or by providing it with relevant information and asking for its thoughts and opinions. Be sure to document the consultation with AI in the issue, including a summary of its insights and any recommendations it may have.

3. **Document the decision-making process**: Clearly document the decision-making process in the issue, including a summary of the consultation with AI and any other relevant information. This should include a description of the options that were considered, the criteria that were used to evaluate them, and the final decision that was reached.

4. **Link to additional evidence**: In the event that the AI's insights are limited or the issue requires additional evidence, link to relevant sources or data to support your argument. This may include research papers, news articles, or other sources of information that can help to provide context and support for your decision.

By following this workflow, we can ensure that our decisions are well-documented and based on a thorough consideration of the available evidence and insights. We believe that this approach will help us to make informed and well-reasoned choices that will help us to achieve our goals and address complex challenges.

## Additional Guidelines

- Be as specific as possible when describing the problem or decision that needs to be made. Clearly define the scope of the issue and any relevant constraints or considerations.

- Involve relevant stakeholders in the decision-making process as appropriate. This may include members of your community, subject matter experts, or other individuals who have relevant knowledge or experience.

- Encourage open and transparent communication throughout the process. Be willing to listen to different perspectives and be open to changing your position based on new evidence or insights.

- Be mindful of the limitations of AI. While AI can be a valuable tool for decision-making, it is not always able to provide complete or accurate information. Be sure to consider the limitations of the AI's insights and be prepared to seek out additional evidence when needed.
